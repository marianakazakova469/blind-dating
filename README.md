## Common issues

Below are some common errors and how to resolve them:

#### 1. APK Installation Failure

**Error:**

```bash
C:<projectc-directory>\blind-dating\uncommon_grounds\build\app\outputs\flutter-apk\app-debug.apk:
```

- **Cause:** This error indicates that a previous installation of your app is already present on your device, and it was signed with a different certificate than your current build. In Android, updating an app requires the signatures to match.
- **Solution:** Uninstall the existing app by using the command line or manually.

#### 2. Device Not Found

**Error:**

```bash
No connected devices.
```

- **Cause:** Flutter cannot detect a connected physical device or emulator.
- **Solution:** Ensure the device is connected and USB debugging is enabled. If using an emulator, ensure it is running. Run ` flutter devices` to confirm connected devices.

#### 3. Flutter SDK Not Found

**Error:**

```bash
Flutter SDK not found.
```

- **Cause:** Flutter environment variables are not set up correctly.
- **Solution:** Confirm Flutter is installed and added to your systemâ€™s PATH. Run `flutter doctor` and follow any suggested fixes.

#### 4. Camera Access Denied

**Error:** Camera does not open or shows a black screen.

- **Cause:** The app lacks proper permissions for camera access.
- **Solution:** Grant camera access manually from device settings.

#### 5. Location Services Denied
